        Honbasho is a fantasy sumo web app built with Python, Flask, and SQLite3.
        <br><br>
        In Sumo tournaments, or Basho, wrestlers (Rikishi) are ranked from Maegashira 17 to Maegashira 1,
        followed by the san’yaku ranks of Komusubi, Sekiwake, Ozeki, and Yokozuna. Tournaments are
        15 days long and Rikishi fight once per day, and the winner is the Rikishi with the most victories.
        <br><br>
        Honbasho is a web-based draft game where one to three players draft a team of Rikishi
        and earn points for every bout their drafted Rikishi wins. Bonus points are awarded when a rank-and-file
        Maegashira defeats a san’yaku opponent, when a wrestler achieves an 8th win (kachikoshi) or 10th win, wining the
        tournament, or for special prizes awarded at the end of the tournament.
